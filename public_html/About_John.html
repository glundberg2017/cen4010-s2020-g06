        Hello! My name is John Callaghan and I'm currently in my second year at Florida Atlantic University. I still have a lot to learn, but I hope to one day work in software developement.
        Other interests of mine include sports and animals. I have always been a huge fan of the Miami Marlins, Miami Heat, and the New York Giants. I also have a cat named snickers.
