        Hi!  I'm Grant Lundberg, or "Grant" for short.  I'm a super old adult with 2 kids (a 10-year-old, and a 5-year-old).<br/>
        I work as a software engineer for a defense contractor in Orlando.<br/> 
        I got the job as an intern 15 years ago and never finished my degree (very unwise).<br/>
        Like everyone else, I'm taking this course so I can graduate someday.
